    <h1>Shepherd's Pie</h1>
    <img src="../images/shephardspie.jpeg">
    <p>Shepherd's Pie is a classic and comforting dish with roots in British and Irish cuisine. This hearty casserole typically consists of a layer of seasoned ground meat, traditionally lamb (hence the name "shepherd's"), mixed with vegetables such as carrots and peas. The meat mixture is then topped with a generous layer of creamy mashed potatoes, creating a golden and crispy crust when baked. Shepherd's Pie is a versatile dish, allowing for variations in ingredients to suit individual tastes. Its warm and satisfying nature makes it a beloved comfort food, perfect for family dinners or chilly evenings when a wholesome and filling meal is desired.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, and cook until onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and red wine (if using). Add basil, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and chopped parsley. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with a portion of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set.</li>
